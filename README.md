# RPG Game with AI-Powered NPCs

## Overview
I've built an RPG game in **Godot** that integrates **Cerebras + Crew AI** to bring NPC agents to life, making every interaction feel fresh and dynamic! 🎮✨

Gone are the days of static, repetitive NPCs—these agents **move, react, and engage in intelligent conversations** powered by **LLM AI**. Each interaction is unique, ensuring that conversations are no longer predictable or dull. 😲💬

## Features
- **Dynamic NPC Conversations**: NPCs respond intelligently and adaptively to player interactions.
- **Unique NPC Personas & Secrets**: Each NPC has a distinct persona and hidden knowledge that players must uncover through careful conversation. 🔍
- **Boss Battles**: The game features **three bosses**, each with their own personality and behavior.
- **Scalability**: Designed to easily add more agents with complex behaviors in future updates. 🤖
- **Real-Time AI Interaction**: A **Flask server** connects the Godot engine with the **Cerebras API**, enabling seamless, real-time responses for immersive gameplay. 🚀
- **Immortal Demo Character**: For demo purposes, the player character is immortal—so no worries, I won’t lose!

## How It Works
1. **Godot Engine**: Handles the game mechanics, graphics, and player interactions.
2. **Cerebras + Crew AI**: Powers the NPCs' intelligence, allowing for adaptive conversations and behaviors.
3. **Flask Server**: Bridges the game with the Cerebras API, ensuring real-time interactions.
